# Bluesky Analytics Feature Plan

## Overview
A modern, insightful analytics dashboard that provides genuine value beyond vanity metrics. Focus on actionable insights, engagement quality, and community understanding.

## Design Philosophy
- **Actionable over Vanity**: Metrics that help users improve their content and engagement
- **Quality over Quantity**: Emphasis on meaningful interactions rather than raw numbers
- **Privacy-Conscious**: Only use publicly available data, respect user privacy
- **Visual Clarity**: Clean, scannable visualizations that tell a story
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works on all devices

## Core Analytics Sections

### 1. Engagement Quality Score (Hero Metric)
A composite score (0-100) that measures:
- **Conversation Depth**: Average replies per post, thread participation
- **Content Resonance**: Ratio of quotes/replies to likes (engagement depth)
- **Network Amplification**: How far content spreads beyond immediate followers
- **Consistency**: Posting regularity and sustained engagement

### 2. Content Performance Analytics
- **Best Performing Posts**: Sorted by engagement quality, not just likes
- **Content Type Analysis**: 
  - Text-only vs media posts
  - Thread performance vs single posts
  - Quote post effectiveness
- **Optimal Posting Times**: Heat map of engagement by day/hour
- **Content Themes**: Most engaging topics/keywords from successful posts

### 3. Audience Insights
- **Active Followers**: Followers who regularly engage (not just follow count)
- **Engagement Circle**: Top 20 users who interact most with your content
- **Audience Growth**: Quality-focused growth chart (active vs passive followers)
- **Mutual Support Network**: Users you both follow and who engage with you

### 4. Network Analysis
- **Interaction Graph**: Visual network of your most connected users
- **Community Clusters**: Groups of users who frequently interact
- **Bridge Connections**: Users who connect different parts of your network

## Technical Implementation

### Data Collection Strategy
1. **Real-time Data**: Current profile stats, recent posts
2. **Historical Analysis**: Last 30 days of posts and engagement
3. **Sampling**: For large datasets, use smart sampling techniques
4. **Caching**: Store calculated metrics for performance

### Key Metrics Calculations

#### Engagement Quality Score (EQS)
```
EQS = (ConversationDepth * 0.3) + 
      (ContentResonance * 0.3) + 
      (NetworkAmplification * 0.2) + 
      (Consistency * 0.2)
```

#### Conversation Depth
```
Average replies per post + 
Average thread depth + 
Quote-to-repost ratio
```

#### Network Amplification
```
Unique reposters outside immediate followers / 
Total reposts
```

### Visualizations
1. **Engagement Timeline**: Area chart showing quality over time
2. **Network Graph**: D3.js force-directed graph of connections
3. **Heat Maps**: Posting time optimization
4. **Radar Charts**: Content type performance
5. **Sankey Diagrams**: Content flow through network
6. **Sparklines**: Mini trends for quick scanning

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with overview, drill down for details
- **Comparative Context**: Show how metrics compare to previous periods
- **Actionable Insights**: Each metric includes "what this means" and "how to improve"
- **Export Options**: Download reports as PDF or CSV
- **Sharing**: Create shareable insight cards
