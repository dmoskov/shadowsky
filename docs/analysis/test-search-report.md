# Search Functionality Test Report

## Test Setup

- **Test Account**: bskyclienttest.bsky.social
- **Search Query**: "non-farm payrolls"
- **App URL**: http://127.0.0.1:5173/

## Implementation Analysis

### Search Components Found:

1. **Search Component** (`/src/components/Search.tsx`)
   - Full search page with Posts and Users tabs
   - Search input with typeahead suggestions
   - Results display for both posts and users
   - Animated UI with Framer Motion

2. **Search Hooks** (`/src/hooks/useSearch.ts`)
   - `useSearchPosts`: Searches for posts matching query
   - `useSearchActors`: Searches for users matching query
   - `useSearchTypeahead`: Provides autocomplete suggestions
   - All hooks use debouncing (300ms for search, 150ms for typeahead)

3. **Search Service** (`/src/services/atproto/search.ts`)
   - Implements AT Protocol search methods
   - `searchActors`: Searches for user profiles
   - `searchPosts`: Searches for posts
   - `searchActorsTypeahead`: Provides user suggestions
   - Proper error handling with AT Protocol error mapping

4. **UI Integration**:
   - Search bar in header (submits on Enter)
   - Mobile search button
   - Direct route to `/search` page
   - Query parameters support (`/search?q=...`)

## Expected Behavior

### When searching for "non-farm payrolls":

1. **Posts Tab**:
   - Should display posts containing "non-farm payrolls"
   - Posts will show with full metadata (author, time, engagement)
   - Loading spinner while searching
   - "No posts found" message if no results

2. **Users Tab**:
   - Should display users with "non-farm payrolls" in their profile
   - User cards show avatar, display name, handle, bio, and follower counts
   - Clicking user navigates to their profile

3. **Typeahead**:
   - As you type, user suggestions appear below search input
   - Clicking suggestion navigates to user profile

## Testing Instructions

1. **Login**:

   ```
   Handle: bskyclienttest.bsky.social
   Password: [provided by user]
   ```

2. **Test Search Bar in Header**:
   - Click on search bar in header
   - Type "non-farm payrolls"
   - Press Enter
   - Should navigate to `/search?q=non-farm%20payrolls`

3. **Test Search Page**:
   - Alternatively, click search icon (mobile view) or navigate to `/search`
   - Enter "non-farm payrolls" in search input
   - Check Posts tab for relevant posts
   - Check Users tab for relevant users

4. **Check Console**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools (Cmd+Option+J)
   - Look for any errors in Console tab
   - Check Network tab for API calls to:
     - `searchPosts`
     - `searchActors`
     - `searchActorsTypeahead`

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Authentication Errors**: If session expired, may need to re-login
2. **Rate Limiting**: AT Protocol may rate limit search requests
3. **Empty Results**: Query might not match any content
4. **Network Errors**: Check if API calls are failing

## Code Quality Notes

- Search implementation follows React best practices
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Debouncing prevents excessive API calls
- Error handling is implemented
- Loading and empty states are handled
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

The search functionality appears to be fully implemented and should work as expected. To test it, you'll need to:

1. Open the app in Chrome
2. Login with the test credentials
3. Use the search feature
4. Monitor the browser console for any errors
