## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Remove Hardcoded Credentials

#### Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Identify all hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Determine environment variable names
- [ ] Plan rollback strategy

#### Implementation

1. Search for credentials:

   ```bash
   grep -r "TEST_USER\|TEST_PASS\|test-credentials" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.mjs"
   ```

2. Create .env.example:

   ```
   VITE_TEST_USER=your_test_user@example.com
   VITE_TEST_PASS=your_test_password
   ```

3. Update .gitignore:

   ```
   .env
   .env.local
   .test-credentials
   ```

4. Update all references to use import.meta.env

#### Verification

- Run: `git grep -i password` (should return no results)
- Run: `git grep test-credentials` (should return no results)
- Test login functionality still works
- Verify no credentials in git history

### Step 2: Testing Infrastructure

#### Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Review current TypeScript config
- [ ] Identify test directory structure
- [ ] Plan test naming conventions

#### Implementation

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install -D jest @jest/globals @types/jest
   npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
   npm install -D jest-environment-jsdom
   npm install -D ts-jest
   ```

2. Create jest.config.js:

   ```javascript
   export default {
     preset: "ts-jest",
     testEnvironment: "jsdom",
     setupFilesAfterEnv: ["<rootDir>/src/test/setup.ts"],
     moduleNameMapper: {
       "\\.(css|less|scss|sass)$": "identity-obj-proxy",
     },
     transform: {
       "^.+\\.tsx?$": [
         "ts-jest",
         {
           tsconfig: {
             jsx: "react-jsx",
           },
         },
       ],
     },
   };
   ```

3. Create src/test/setup.ts:

   ```typescript
   import "@testing-library/jest-dom";
   ```

4. Add test scripts to package.json:
   ```json
   "test": "jest",
   "test:watch": "jest --watch",
   "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
   ```

#### Verification

- Run `npm test` (should execute successfully)
- Create smoke test and verify it runs
- Check coverage report generates

### Step 3: First Critical Path Test

#### Target: usePostInteractions hook (Like functionality)

1. Create src/hooks/**tests**/usePostInteractions.test.tsx
2. Test optimistic updates
3. Test error handling
4. Test rate limiting

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] Test passes reliably
- [ ] Coverage report shows hook covered
- [ ] No console warnings during test
