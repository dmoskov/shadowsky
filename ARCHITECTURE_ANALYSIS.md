3. **Security hardening** - Test credentials in code, XSS prevention needed
4. **Performance monitoring** - No metrics collection in production
5. **Component architecture** - Some components exceed 300 lines

## 1. Architecture and Code Organization

### Current State
The project follows a feature-based organization pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── components/      # UI components (recently reorganized)
│   ├── core/       # Essential app components
│   ├── feed/       # Feed-related components
│   ├── thread/     # Thread visualization
│   ├── analytics/  # Analytics dashboard (new)
│   └── ui/         # Reusable UI elements
├── services/       # AT Protocol integration
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
├── contexts/       # React contexts
├── lib/            # Utilities and helpers
└── styles/         # CSS modules
```

### Strengths
- Clear separation between presentation and business logic
- Service layer abstraction for AT Protocol operations
- Consistent file naming and structure
- Recent refactoring improved component organization

### Concerns
- Some components are too large (ThreadView: 300+ lines)
- Analytics feature has 3 different implementation files (analytics.ts, analytics-enhanced.ts, analytics-stored.ts)
- Missing unit tests for critical business logic
- No clear domain boundaries for larger features

### Recommendations
1. **Implement domain-driven design** for complex features like analytics
2. **Split large components** using the compound component pattern
3. **Add barrel exports** consistently across all directories
4. **Create feature modules** with co-located tests, types, and utilities

## 2. Performance and Scalability

### Current Metrics
- Bundle size: ~450KB (could be optimized)
- First paint: ~1.2s local dev
- No production performance monitoring
- React Query handles caching effectively

### Performance Features
- **Rate limiting** implementation prevents API abuse
- **Request deduplication** avoids duplicate API calls
- **Infinite scrolling** for feed pagination
- **Optimistic updates** ready but not fully implemented

### Bottlenecks
1. **Bundle size** - AT Protocol SDK adds ~150KB
2. **No code splitting** - All routes loaded upfront
3. **Image optimization** - Avatars loaded without lazy loading
4. **Missing virtualization** for long lists

### Recommendations
1. **Implement route-based code splitting**
   ```typescript
   const Analytics = lazy(() => import('./components/analytics/Analytics'))
   ```
2. **Add virtual scrolling** for feed and thread views
3. **Optimize images** with next-gen formats and lazy loading
4. **Add performance monitoring** with Web Vitals
5. **Implement service worker** for offline capabilities

## 3. Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures
- Session tokens stored in localStorage
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Input sanitization for user content
- Error messages don't expose sensitive data

### Security Vulnerabilities
1. **Hardcoded test credentials** in multiple test files
2. **No XSS protection** for user-generated content
3. **Missing CSRF protection** for state-changing operations
4. **No rate limiting** on client-side (only server-side)
5. **localStorage** vulnerable to XSS attacks

### Recommendations
1. **Move credentials to environment variables**
   ```typescript
   const TEST_CREDENTIALS = {
     username: process.env.VITE_TEST_USERNAME,
     password: process.env.VITE_TEST_PASSWORD
   }
   ```
2. **Implement Content Security Policy**
3. **Add DOMPurify** for user content sanitization
4. **Use httpOnly cookies** for session management
5. **Add client-side rate limiting** for sensitive operations

## 4. Code Quality and Maintainability

### Positive Aspects
- TypeScript throughout with minimal `any` usage
- Consistent code style and formatting
- Good error handling patterns
- Clear naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation

### Areas for Improvement
1. **No automated testing** - 0% coverage is a critical risk
2. **Large components** - Several exceed 200 lines
3. **Inconsistent error boundaries** - Not all routes protected
4. **Magic numbers** in CSS and calculations
5. **Duplicate code** in test scripts

### Recommendations
1. **Establish testing pyramid**
   - Unit tests for services and utilities (60%)
   - Integration tests for hooks and contexts (30%)
   - E2E tests for critical user flows (10%)
2. **Add pre-commit hooks** for linting and type checking
3. **Implement component size limits** with ESLint
4. **Extract constants** for all magic numbers
5. **Add JSDoc comments** for public APIs

## 5. Testing Strategy

### Current State
- Playwright setup for E2E testing
- Multiple test scripts but low maintainability
- No unit or integration tests
- Manual testing predominant
