# Debugging Notifications App

## Current Status

- ✅ App loads without console errors
- ✅ Login form is displayed
- ✅ AuthContext provides both `client` and `agent` properties
- ✅ NotificationsDashboard uses correct API method: `agent.app.bsky.notification.listNotifications()`

## To See Notifications

1. **Login First**: The app shows a login form because you're not authenticated. You need to:
   - Enter your Bluesky handle (e.g., yourhandle.bsky.social)
   - Enter your password
   - Click Login

2. **After Login**: The app should redirect to the dashboard and show:
   - Notification statistics (Total, Unread, Likes, Follows)
   - Notification breakdown chart
   - Recent activity list

## What's Fixed

- Fixed `agent` not being available in AuthContext
- Fixed API call from `agent.listNotifications()` to `agent.app.bsky.notification.listNotifications()`

## Next Steps

1. Log in to the app using your Bluesky credentials
2. Check if notifications appear on the dashboard
3. If not, check the browser console for any API errors

## Quick Test

Open http://localhost:5174/ in your browser and log in with your Bluesky credentials.
