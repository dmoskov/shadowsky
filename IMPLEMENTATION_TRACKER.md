# Distinguished Engineer Implementation Tracker

## Implementation Philosophy
"Move deliberately and fix things" - We will make changes systematically, with verification at each step.

## Tracking Metrics
- **Risk Reduction**: Measure security/stability improvements
- **Coverage Increase**: Track test coverage percentage
- **Performance Gains**: Monitor bundle size and load times
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure no regressions

## Implementation Log

### 2025-01-08 06:45 - Secure Credentials Implementation
**Task**: Remove Hardcoded Credentials  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Changes Made**:
- Created .env.example with template for environment variables
- Created .env.local with actual credentials (git-ignored)
- Built src/lib/test-credentials.ts for type-safe credential access
- Created tests/playwright/helpers/credentials.js with fallback support
- Installed dotenv as dev dependency
- Created test-thread-secure.js as reference implementation
**Verification**:
- Test with env vars: ‚úÖ (successful login and thread navigation)
- Credentials masked in logs: ‚úÖ (shows traviskimmel+bsky@****)
- .env.local ignored by git: ‚úÖ
- Vite detected env changes: ‚úÖ (server restarted automatically)
**Notes**: 
- Legacy .test-credentials still exists for backward compatibility
- Need to migrate all 20+ test scripts to new system
- Vite automatically loads VITE_ prefixed env vars
**Next Step**: Create migration script to update all test files

### 2025-01-08 06:50 - Security Task Completed
**Task**: Remove Hardcoded Credentials (Core Implementation)  
**Status**: Completed  
**Changes Made**:
- Migration analysis script created and executed
- Found 20 files needing migration across tests/ and scripts/
- Created CREDENTIAL_MIGRATION_REPORT.json with full analysis
- Built SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md documentation
- Committed all security improvements to git
**Verification**:
- No passwords in git: ‚úÖ (git grep finds nothing)
- Migration script works: ‚úÖ (analyzed 61 files successfully)
- Documentation complete: ‚úÖ
- Git commit clean: ‚úÖ
**Security Impact**:
- Critical vulnerability addressed
- Clear migration path established
- Developer documentation provided
- Backward compatibility maintained
**Remaining Work**:
- 19 test files still need migration
- This is tracked as separate task
**Next Step**: Set up Jest testing infrastructure

### 2025-01-08 07:05 - Jest Testing Infrastructure Complete
**Task**: Set Up Testing Infrastructure  
**Status**: Completed  
**Changes Made**:
- Installed Jest, ts-jest, and React Testing Library
- Created jest.config.js with TypeScript support
- Set up test environment with jsdom
- Added test setup file with window API mocks
- Created test utilities for common patterns
- Added npm test scripts (test, test:watch, test:coverage)
- Fixed AuthProvider mocking strategy
- Added TextEncoder/TextDecoder polyfills
**Verification**:
- Smoke test passes: ‚úÖ (5/5 tests)
- First real test runs: ‚úÖ (6/9 tests passing)
- TypeScript compilation: ‚úÖ
- Coverage reporting: ‚úÖ
**Technical Decisions**:
- Used ts-jest for TypeScript support
- Mocked auth at hook level to avoid provider complexity
- Used identity-obj-proxy for CSS module mocking
- Set coverage thresholds to 0% initially (will increase)
**Challenges Resolved**:
- AuthProvider didn't accept value prop - mocked useAuth instead
- TextEncoder not defined - added polyfill in setup
- React Router required TextEncoder - fixed with util import
**Test Results**:
- usePostInteractions hook: 66% tests passing
- Optimistic updates working correctly
- Error handling and reversion tested
- Edge cases need refinement
**Next Step**: Fix remaining test failures and increase coverage

### 2025-01-08 07:20 - Fixed usePostInteractions Test Failures
**Task**: Fix failing tests in usePostInteractions  
**Status**: Completed  
**Changes Made**:
- Fixed loading state test by properly managing async promise resolution
- Fixed zero counts edge case by mocking successful unlike operation
- Fixed posts not in timeline test by adding mock response
- Removed console.log statements from hook for cleaner output
**Verification**:
- All tests passing: ‚úÖ (9/9 tests)
- Loading state test: ‚úÖ (properly captures async states)
- Edge case tests: ‚úÖ (handle zero counts and missing data)
- No console warnings: ‚úÖ
**Technical Details**:
- Used waitFor() to properly test async loading states
- Ensured all mocks return appropriate responses
- Maintained test isolation with beforeEach setup
**Coverage Results**:
- usePostInteractions hook: 82.1% line coverage
- Overall project coverage: 3.47%
- Hook is now well-tested for critical path
**Next Step**: Add tests for useAuth hook to continue building coverage

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Remove Hardcoded Credentials

#### Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Identify all hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Determine environment variable names
- [ ] Plan rollback strategy

#### Implementation
1. Search for credentials:
   ```bash
   grep -r "TEST_USER\|TEST_PASS\|test-credentials" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.mjs"
   ```

2. Create .env.example:
   ```
   VITE_TEST_USER=your_test_user@example.com
   VITE_TEST_PASS=your_test_password
   ```

3. Update .gitignore:
   ```
   .env
   .env.local
   .test-credentials
   ```

4. Update all references to use import.meta.env

#### Verification
- Run: `git grep -i password` (should return no results)
- Run: `git grep test-credentials` (should return no results)
- Test login functionality still works
- Verify no credentials in git history

### Step 2: Testing Infrastructure

#### Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review current TypeScript config
- [ ] Identify test directory structure
- [ ] Plan test naming conventions

#### Implementation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install -D jest @jest/globals @types/jest
   npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
   npm install -D jest-environment-jsdom
   npm install -D ts-jest
   ```

2. Create jest.config.js:
   ```javascript
   export default {
     preset: 'ts-jest',
     testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
     setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/test/setup.ts'],
     moduleNameMapper: {
       '\\.(css|less|scss|sass)$': 'identity-obj-proxy',
     },
     transform: {
       '^.+\\.tsx?$': ['ts-jest', {
         tsconfig: {
           jsx: 'react-jsx',
         },
       }],
     },
   }
   ```

3. Create src/test/setup.ts:
   ```typescript
   import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
   ```

4. Add test scripts to package.json:
   ```json
   "test": "jest",
   "test:watch": "jest --watch",
   "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
   ```

#### Verification
- Run `npm test` (should execute successfully)
- Create smoke test and verify it runs
- Check coverage report generates

### Step 3: First Critical Path Test

#### Target: usePostInteractions hook (Like functionality)

1. Create src/hooks/__tests__/usePostInteractions.test.tsx
2. Test optimistic updates
3. Test error handling
4. Test rate limiting

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Test passes reliably
- [ ] Coverage report shows hook covered
- [ ] No console warnings during test

## Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete:
1. **Code Review**: Would I approve this PR?
2. **Testing**: Is it tested or testable?
3. **Documentation**: Will someone understand this in 6 months?
4. **Performance**: Did we measure impact?
5. **Security**: Did we introduce new risks?

## Rollback Plans

For each change:
- Git commit before changes
- Document rollback steps
- Test rollback procedure
- Keep previous config accessible

## Success Metrics

Week 1 Target:
- Security vulnerabilities: 0
- Test coverage: >0% (from 0%)
- Error monitoring: Active
- Performance baseline: Recorded

Week 2 Target:
- Test coverage: 10%
- CI pipeline: Running
- Bundle size: -10%
