- Bundle size: ~450 KB (estimated)
- First paint: ~1.2s (local dev)
- Error rate: Low (PostCSS warnings only)
- Features completed: 8/25

## Performance Notes
- Dev server: Stable with automatic restart
- Memory usage: Not measured
- API response times: Good (< 500ms typical)
- Render performance: Some jankiness reported

## Bundle Composition (Estimated)
- React + ReactDOM: ~130 KB
- @atproto/api: ~150 KB
- React Query: ~30 KB
- Other deps: ~100 KB
- App code: ~40 KB

## Optimization Opportunities
1. Lazy load @atproto/api modules
2. Code split by route (when routes added)
3. Optimize images (avatars)
4. Implement virtual scrolling for long feeds
5. Add service worker for offline support
