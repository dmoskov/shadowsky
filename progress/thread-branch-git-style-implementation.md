# Thread Branch Diagram - Git Style Implementation

## Date: 2025-06-06

### What Was Requested
The user pointed out that the previous visualization was tiny and getting cut off. They wanted something more like a git branch visualization - properly scaled, full-height, with clear vertical flow.

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. **Complete Redesign**
- Scrapped the cramped horizontal tree layout
- Implemented vertical git-style branch visualization
- Each post is a "commit" node with connecting lines

#### 2. **Proper Sizing**
- Container height: `calc(100vh - 400px)` with min 400px, max 600px
- Full-width visualization that uses available space
- Scrollable container for long threads
- SVG dimensions calculated based on content

#### 3. **Git-Style Elements**
- **Commit dots**: Colored circles at x positions based on branch
- **Branch lines**: Curved paths connecting parent to child posts
- **Commit cards**: 160x64px cards showing:
  - Author name (truncated to 18 chars)
  - Post text preview (30 chars)
  - Reply count and heat indicator
- **Color coding**: 8 different colors for different branches

#### 4. **Layout Algorithm**
```javascript
// Vertical layout with column management
const NODE_HEIGHT = 80
const COLUMN_WIDTH = 40
const START_Y = 40

// Smart column allocation to prevent overlaps
const findFreeColumn = (parentColumn, y) => {
  // Try parent column first, then find free space
}
```

#### 5. **Visual Design**
- **Background**: Dark grid pattern (#0d1117) like code editors
- **Branch colors**: Blue, red, green, amber, purple, pink, teal, orange
- **Active state**: White border on selected node
- **Hover effects**: Lift animation and detailed tooltip
- **Smooth animations**: Path drawing and node appearance

#### 6. **Interactive Features**
- Click any node to navigate to that post
- Hover for detailed tooltip showing:
  - Full author name
  - Longer text preview (100 chars)
  - Timestamp and engagement metrics
- Tooltip positioned at bottom-right to not obstruct view

### Technical Details

#### Component Structure
```typescript
interface ThreadBranch {
  id: string
  uri: string
  author: string
  text: string  // Added to show preview
  color?: string  // Branch color
  isMainLine?: boolean
  // ... other properties
}

interface LayoutNode {
  branch: ThreadBranch
  x: number  // Column position
  y: number  // Vertical position
  column: number  // Track which column
  children: LayoutNode[]
}
```

#### Key Improvements Over Previous Version
1. **Vertical not horizontal** - Natural reading flow
2. **Proper height** - Uses significant viewport space
3. **Git metaphor** - Familiar to developers
4. **Text previews** - Can see conversation content
5. **Better spacing** - 80px between nodes vertically
6. **Column management** - Prevents branch overlaps

### Result
The thread branch diagram now provides a clear, readable visualization that:
- Shows the full conversation structure at a glance
- Uses familiar git-style visual language
- Scales properly for complex threads
- Provides enough detail to understand context
- Looks polished and professional

The visualization is no longer tiny or cut off - it's a prominent, useful feature that helps users navigate complex conversations.
