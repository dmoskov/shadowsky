### What Was Fixed

#### 1. **Compose Button Relocation**
- Moved from bottom-right to bottom-left
- No longer overlaps with thread navigation
- Maintains same size and functionality

#### 2. **Color Contrast & Readability**

- **Font sizes**: Increased to 13px for author names, 11px for reply counts
- **Avatar initials**: Larger (14px) and bold white text

#### 3. **Visual Hierarchy**

- **Level gap**: 100px between parent and child (was 60px)
- **Sibling gap**: 20px between branches (was 10px)
- **Container padding**: Increased for better breathing room

#### 5. **Progressive Disclosure**
- **Expand indicators**: Styled as gray pills with white text
