# Bluesky Client Development Session 4
**Date**: January 6, 2025
**Duration**: ~2.5 hours
**Focus**: Authentication fixes, Profile implementation, Thread view improvements

## Summary
Continued development from previous session that ran out of context. Fixed critical authentication issues throughout the codebase, implemented comprehensive user profile functionality with follow/unfollow capabilities, and significantly improved thread view with proper visual hierarchy for nested conversations.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Authentication & API Usage Issues ✅
**Problem**: Multiple services were using deprecated convenience methods and non-authenticated agents, causing "Could not find repo" and "authentication failed" errors.

**Solution**:
- Updated all services to use proper `app.bsky.*` namespace methods instead of deprecated convenience methods
- Fixed services that were using raw `atClient` instead of authenticated agents
- Created comprehensive documentation (`AGENT_USAGE_GUIDE.md`) to prevent future issues
- Removed dangerous `atClient` export to prevent misuse

**Files Updated**:
- `src/services/atproto/search.ts` - Fixed searchPosts/searchActors methods
- `src/services/atproto/thread.ts` - Fixed getPostThread method
- `src/services/atproto/interactions.ts` - Complete refactor to use authenticated agent
- `src/services/atproto/notifications.ts` - Updated to proper namespaces
- `src/services/atproto/profile.ts` - Fixed follow/unfollow methods
- `src/services/atproto/feed.ts` - Updated all methods to proper namespaces
- `src/services/atproto/client.ts` - Removed dangerous exports, added agent getter

### 2. Implemented Complete Profile Functionality ✅
**Features Added**:
- Profile viewing with loading skeleton
- Follow/unfollow functionality with optimistic updates
- Clickable follower/following counts
- Modal to view followers and following lists
- Profile stats display
- Banner image support
- Join date formatting
- Tab structure for posts/replies/media/likes (UI ready)

**New Components**:
- `src/components/FollowersModal.tsx` - Modal for viewing followers/following
- `src/styles/followers-modal.css` - Styling for the modal

**Enhancements**:
- Added `useFollowers` and `useFollowing` hooks
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design
- Smooth animations

### 3. Fixed Thread View Hierarchy ✅
**Problem**: Thread replies were displayed as a flat list with no visual hierarchy, making it impossible to tell who was replying to whom.

**Solution**:
- Rewrote thread rendering to maintain nested structure
- Added visual branching with connecting lines
- Implemented proper indentation for nested replies
- Added "Replying to @username" indicators
- Created hover effects for connection lines
- Added depth-based styling (borders, opacity)

**Visual Improvements**:
- Vertical lines connecting parent and child posts
- Horizontal connectors showing reply relationships
- Branching structure for multi-reply threads
- Responsive design with smaller indents on mobile
- Maximum depth capping for readability

### 4. Fixed TypeScript Build Errors ✅
- Fixed all authentication-related type errors
- Resolved issues with `response.data` vs direct response returns
- Fixed unused variable warnings
- Corrected import issues with type-only imports
- Fixed duplicate key warnings in thread rendering

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Removed singleton pattern from services (was causing agent sharing issues)
- Improved type safety throughout
- Better error handling and mapping
- Consistent use of authenticated agents

### Performance
- All builds completing successfully
- Optimistic UI updates for follow actions
- Efficient thread rendering with proper keys

## Bug Fixes
1. ✅ "Could not find repo" errors when searching
2. ✅ Logout not working (agent.session is read-only)
3. ✅ Thread view authentication errors
4. ✅ Search functionality authentication issues
5. ✅ Profile follow/unfollow not using authenticated agent
6. ✅ Duplicate React keys in thread rendering
7. ✅ Invalid session format warnings

## Current State
The app now has:
- Stable authentication throughout all services
- Fully functional profile viewing and following
- Proper thread hierarchy visualization
- Working search (needs UI refinement)
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- Clean build output

## Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. **Search Refinement** - The search works but needs better UI/UX
2. **Notifications** - Implement notification feed and badges
3. **Post Deletion** - Add ability to delete own posts
4. **Image Uploads** - Enable image attachments for posts
5. **Profile Tabs** - Implement replies, media, and likes tabs

## Lessons Learned
1. **Always use authenticated agents** - Never use the raw client singleton
2. **Check API method signatures** - Some return `data` wrapper, others don't
3. **Namespace methods are required** - Convenience methods are deprecated
4. **Test authentication thoroughly** - Auth issues cascade through the app
5. **Visual hierarchy matters** - Flat thread lists are confusing for users

## Code Snippets for Reference

### Proper Agent Usage Pattern
```typescript
const { data: session } = await this.agent.com.atproto.server.getSession()
const result = await this.agent.app.bsky.feed.like.create(
  { repo: session.did },
  {
    subject: { uri: post.uri, cid: post.cid },
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
  }
)
```

### Thread Rendering with Hierarchy
```typescript
function renderThreadReplies(replies, depth, onReply, ancestors) {
  return replies.map((reply, index) => {
    if (reply.$type !== 'app.bsky.feed.defs#threadViewPost') return null
    
    const threadReply = reply as ThreadViewPost
    const hasReplies = threadReply.replies && threadReply.replies.length > 0
    
    return (
      <div key={`${threadReply.post.uri}-${depth}-${index}`} className="thread-branch">
        {/* Reply content */}
        {hasReplies && (
          <div className="thread-children">
            {renderThreadReplies(threadReply.replies, depth + 1, onReply, ancestors)}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    )
  })
}
```
