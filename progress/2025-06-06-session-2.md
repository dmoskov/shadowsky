# Session 2: Major Architecture Refactor
**Date**: June 6, 2025
**Duration**: ~30 minutes

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive architectural improvements based on principal engineer critique. Transformed the MVP into a production-ready codebase with proper AT Protocol patterns, type safety, and modern React data management.

## Goals Accomplished
1. ✅ Installed additional dependencies (React Query, Zod, AT Protocol packages)
2. ✅ Created proper type system with official AT Protocol types
3. ✅ Implemented comprehensive error handling system
4. ✅ Refactored service layer with clean architecture
5. ✅ Integrated React Query for data fetching
6. ✅ Updated documentation with new conventions

## Major Changes

### Type System
- Created `src/types/atproto.ts` with official AT Protocol type exports
- Created `src/types/app.ts` with Zod schemas for validation
- Eliminated all `any` types from the codebase

### Error Handling
- Custom error classes in `src/lib/errors.ts`:
  - `ATProtoError` (base class)
  - `NetworkError`
  - `AuthenticationError`
  - `RateLimitError`
  - `SessionExpiredError`
- Automatic error mapping from API responses
- `useErrorHandler` hook for consistent error handling

### Service Architecture
```
src/services/atproto/
├── client.ts    # Main AT Protocol client
├── feed.ts      # Feed-related operations
└── index.ts     # Service exports
```

- Proper encapsulation of AT Protocol operations
- Type-safe method signatures
- Automatic session persistence
- Error propagation through layers

### Data Management
- React Query integration for:
  - Automatic caching
  - Background refetching
  - Infinite scrolling
  - Optimistic updates
- `useTimeline` hook for feed data
- Cursor-based pagination support

### UI Improvements
- Loading states during auth initialization
- "Load more" button for infinite scrolling
- Disabled states during operations
- Proper error feedback

## Technical Decisions

### Why React Query?
- Industry standard for server state management
- Built-in caching and synchronization
- Reduces boilerplate code
- Better performance with deduplication

### Why Zod?
- Runtime validation for user inputs
- Type inference from schemas
- Better error messages
- Prevents invalid data early

### Service Layer Pattern
- Separation of concerns
- Easier testing
- Consistent error handling
- Future-proof for additional features

## Code Quality Improvements
- No more `any` types
- Proper error boundaries
- Consistent naming conventions
- Clear module boundaries
- Better IDE support with types

## Performance Improvements
- Queries are cached for 1 minute
- Background refetching
- Request deduplication
- Previous data shown while fetching
- Infinite scroll instead of full reload

## Next Steps
1. Implement post creation with optimistic updates
2. Add like/unlike functionality
3. Implement repost feature
4. Add thread view
5. Create user profile component
6. Add real-time updates via FireHose
7. Implement image uploads

## Breaking Changes
- Removed `src/services/atproto.ts`
- Changed import paths for services
- AuthContext now provides `isLoading` state
- Feed component uses React Query hooks

## Migration Notes
- All service imports now from `src/services/atproto`
- Error handling should use `useErrorHandler`
- Data fetching should use React Query hooks
- Types should be imported from `src/types/*`

## Lessons Learned
1. **Start with proper types** - Retrofitting is harder
2. **Plan error handling early** - Critical for good UX
3. **Use proven patterns** - React Query solves many problems
4. **Service layer pays off** - Clean separation of concerns

This refactor positions the codebase for rapid feature development while maintaining high code quality standards.
