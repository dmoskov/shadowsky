# Session: Feed Audit and Analytics Implementation
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Focus**: Analytics system completion and feed quality improvements

## Summary
This session focused on completing the analytics system implementation and beginning a comprehensive feed audit after user feedback about display issues.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Analytics System with IndexedDB âœ…
Built a robust multi-user analytics system with local storage:
- **Database Schema**: Users, posts, daily snapshots, engagement history
- **Sync Service**: Full post fetch on first sync, incremental updates after
- **Background Sync**: Automatic updates every 30 minutes
- **Multi-User Support**: Isolated data by DID

Fixed critical bugs:
- Engagement Quality Score showing "NaN"
- Unrealistic 18.2% engagement rate (fixed formula)
- 0 characters average (fixed text extraction)
- 0 active engagers (fixed calculation)

### 2. Network Health Made Actionable âœ…
Transformed confusing network metrics into actionable insights:
- Plain language health status ("Growing", "Stable", "Needs Attention")
- Quick diagnosis of specific issues
- 3 specific actionable recommendations with impact
- Created NetworkHealthActionable component

### 3. Fixed Image Display Issues âœ…
- Added CSS grid layouts for 1-4 image configurations
- Images now display properly instead of as thin horizontal strips
- Proper responsive design for mobile

### 4. Started Like Button Debugging ðŸ”„
- Added comprehensive logging to trace issues
- Enhanced authentication checks
- Added rate limiting to interactions
- Created test scripts for debugging

## Technical Decisions

### IndexedDB for Analytics
Chose IndexedDB over localStorage/API for:
- No size limits
- Better performance with large datasets
- Built-in versioning
- Transaction support

### Logarithmic Scaling for Metrics
Replaced linear scaling with logarithmic to prevent gaming:
```javascript
// Example: Reply score
const replyScore = avgRepliesPerPost > 0 
  ? Math.log10(avgRepliesPerPost + 1) / Math.log10(11) * 100 
  : 0
```

## Bugs Fixed
1. **Analytics calculations** - All metrics now calculate correctly
2. **Image grid layouts** - Multi-image posts display properly
3. **Sync loop** - Fixed isFirstSync logic
4. **Array initialization** - Fixed "existing.likes is not iterable"

## Current Issues
1. **Like button not working** - Under investigation
2. **PostCSS import warnings** - Non-breaking but annoying

## Files Changed
- `/src/services/analytics-db.ts` - New IndexedDB service
- `/src/services/analytics-sync.ts` - New sync service
- `/src/services/atproto/analytics-enhanced.ts` - Fixed calculations
- `/src/components/analytics/NetworkHealthActionable.tsx` - New component
- `/src/styles/post-card.css` - Fixed image layouts
- `/src/components/feed/PostCard.tsx` - Added debug logging
- `/src/services/atproto/interactions.ts` - Enhanced auth checks

## Next Steps
1. Continue debugging like button with browser console
2. Implement image lightbox
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Fix remaining feed interactions (repost, reply, share)

## Lessons Learned
1. AT Protocol stores text directly as `record.text`, not `record.value.text`
2. Engagement rate should be calculated against follower base
3. Always check for array existence before iterating in sync operations
4. Linear scaling creates unrealistic metrics - use logarithmic for natural distribution

## User Feedback
- "Wow this is a great start!" - On initial analytics
- "This whole section is cool I just have no idea what to do with it" - Led to actionable redesign
- "This is a really weird way to display 4 images" - Fixed with grid layouts
- "I don't think the 'like' button is working" - Current focus
