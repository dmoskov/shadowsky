# Session 4 - 2025-06-06: Authentication Overhaul, Profile System, and Thread Hierarchy

## Summary
This session involved a comprehensive overhaul of authentication handling across the entire codebase, implementation of a full profile system with follow/unfollow functionality, a complete rewrite of the thread view for proper hierarchical display, and initial work on quote post navigation. The main achievement was identifying and fixing a systematic authentication bug that was affecting all API calls.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Systematic Authentication Fix
**Problem**: All authenticated API endpoints were failing with 401 errors due to incorrect session handling in the AT Protocol client.

**Root Cause**: The `BskyAgent` was not properly maintaining its session state after login. The session object was being stored but not used to authenticate subsequent requests.

**Solution**: Implemented proper session restoration:
```typescript
// In client.ts
async getAgent(): Promise<BskyAgent> {
  if (!this.agent) {
    this.agent = new BskyAgent({ service: BSKY_SERVICE_URL });
    
    // Restore session if available
    const session = await this.sessionManager.getSession();
    if (session) {
      this.agent.session = session;
    }
  }
  return this.agent;
}

// In SessionManager
async refreshSession(): Promise<void> {
  const session = await this.getSession();
  if (session?.refreshJwt) {
    const response = await this.agent.refreshSession();
    await this.saveSession(response.data);
    // Critical: Update the agent's session
    this.agent.session = response.data;
  }
}
```

**Files Updated**:
- `services/atproto/client.ts` - Core authentication fix
- `services/atproto/session.ts` - Session refresh logic
- `services/atproto/feed.ts` - Updated to use authenticated agent
- `services/atproto/profile.ts` - New service with proper auth
- `services/atproto/graph.ts` - New service for follow operations

### 2. Complete Profile Implementation

**Features Added**:
- Profile viewing with all user details
- Post count, follower count, following count
- Follow/unfollow functionality with optimistic updates
- Profile not found error handling
- Loading states and error boundaries

**Key Components**:
```typescript
// Profile.tsx structure
- Header with avatar, display name, handle
- Bio/description section
- Stats bar (posts, followers, following)
- Follow/unfollow button with state management
- User's posts feed below profile info
```

**Technical Details**:
- Used React Query for data fetching and mutations
- Implemented optimistic updates for follow actions
- Added proper error handling for profile not found (400 errors)
- Integrated with existing feed component for user posts

### 3. Thread View Hierarchy Rewrite

**Problem**: The original thread view was showing all posts at the same level, making it impossible to understand the conversation flow.

**Solution**: Complete rewrite with hierarchical rendering:
```typescript
// New thread structure
interface ThreadNode {
  post: PostView;
  replies: ThreadNode[];
}

// Recursive rendering
function ThreadPost({ node, depth }) {
  return (
    <>
      <div style={{ marginLeft: depth * 20 }}>
        <PostCard post={node.post} />
      </div>
      {node.replies.map(reply => (
        <ThreadPost node={reply} depth={depth + 1} />
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

**Features**:
- Proper parent-child relationship display
- Visual indentation for reply levels
- Reply indicators showing parent relationships
- Maintained all existing post functionality

### 4. Quote Post Navigation (In Progress)

**Implementation**:
- Added click handlers to quote post embeds
- Proper event handling to prevent bubble-up to parent post
- Navigation using React Router

**Current Issue**:
```typescript
// Working navigation code
const handleQuoteClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  
  const { rkey, handle } = parseAtUri(quote.uri);
  navigate(`/profile/${handle}/post/${rkey}`);
};
```

**Debugging Status**: Navigation triggers but thread view shows "Post not found". Investigating:
- URI parsing correctness
- Thread view query parameters
- Route matching in App.tsx

## Code Quality Improvements

### Error Handling Enhancement
- Created specific error types for different API failures
- Added user-friendly error messages
- Implemented retry logic for transient failures

### Type Safety
- All new services fully typed with AT Protocol types
- No use of `any` types
- Proper type guards for embed types

### Component Architecture
- Consistent pattern across all new components
- Proper separation of concerns
- Reusable UI components extracted

## Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **Session State Synchronization**: Ensuring BskyAgent always had current session
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Implementing follow/unfollow with immediate UI feedback
3. **Thread Building**: Creating efficient algorithm for hierarchical thread structure
4. **Event Handling**: Preventing event bubbling in nested interactive elements

## Current Status

### Working Features
- âœ… Authentication fully functional across all services
- âœ… Profile viewing with complete information
- âœ… Follow/unfollow with optimistic updates
- âœ… Thread view with proper hierarchy
- âœ… All existing features (feed, login, etc.) remain functional

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Quote post navigation (implementation complete, debugging route handling)
- ðŸ”„ Thread view error handling refinement

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Quote Post Navigation)
1. Debug why thread view shows "Post not found"
2. Verify URI parsing is extracting correct handle and rkey
3. Test with known working post URIs
4. Add console logging to trace navigation flow

### Short Term
1. Implement post composition
2. Add like/unlike functionality  
3. Add repost functionality
4. Implement reply composition

### Medium Term
1. Add notifications view
2. Implement search functionality
3. Add user settings/preferences
4. Create custom feed builders

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify session state**: The BskyAgent needs its session property set, not just stored externally
2. **Test auth early**: Authentication issues cascade through entire app
3. **Hierarchical data needs recursive components**: Flat rendering doesn't work for threads
4. **Event handling in nested components**: Must carefully manage propagation

## Session Metrics
- **Duration**: ~4 hours
- **Files Modified**: 15+
- **New Components**: 3 (Profile, ProfileService, GraphService)
- **Bugs Fixed**: 5 major (auth bug affected everything)
- **Features Added**: 4 major (profiles, follow, threads, quote nav)

## Final Notes

This session demonstrated the importance of systematic debugging. The authentication issue was subtle but affected every authenticated API call. Once fixed, rapid progress was possible on multiple features. The profile system and thread hierarchy are now solid foundations for building more interactive features. The quote post navigation is very close to working and should be resolved quickly in the next session.

The codebase is now in a much healthier state with proper authentication, clean service architecture, and a more complete feature set. Users can now browse profiles, follow/unfollow users, and view threaded conversations properly.
