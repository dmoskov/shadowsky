🔍 Search Typeahead Bug Fix Verification
========================================

The bug has been fixed in src/components/Search.tsx

WHAT WAS FIXED:
1. When clicking "Add user" and pressing arrow down with an empty input,
   the component would show an empty dropdown.

2. The issue was in the handleKeyDown function where it would set
   showSuggestions=true even when followersWithData was empty.

HOW IT WAS FIXED:
1. Added a check to only show the dropdown if followersWithData.length > 0
2. Added null checks for userSuggestions array in dropdown render conditions
3. Modified the arrow down handler to check if followers are loaded before showing dropdown

CHANGES MADE:
- Line 390-394: Only show followers dropdown if we have followers loaded
- Line 657 & 1062: Added null check for userSuggestions array

TO VERIFY MANUALLY:
1. Open http://localhost:5175/search
2. Click "Add user" button
3. With the input field focused and empty, press the down arrow key
4. Verify: No empty dropdown should appear
5. If you're logged in with followers, the dropdown should show your followers

The fix ensures a better user experience by preventing empty dropdowns.
