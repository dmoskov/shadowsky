# Search Component Typeahead Fix Test

This test verifies the fix for the bug where an empty dropdown appeared when pressing the down arrow key after clicking "Add user" in the search component.

## Bug Description

When users clicked "Add user" and then pressed the down arrow key, the typeahead would show an empty dropdown if the followers data hadn't loaded yet.

## Fix Applied

The fix ensures that:

1. The dropdown only shows when there are actual suggestions to display
2. The arrow down key only triggers the dropdown if `followersWithData` has content
3. Proper null/undefined checks are in place for the `userSuggestions` array

## Running the Test

1. First, make sure your development server is running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Install test dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd tests/e2e
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the test:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## What the Test Checks

1. **Empty Dropdown Prevention**: Verifies that pressing arrow down on an empty input doesn't show an empty dropdown
2. **Normal Typeahead**: Ensures regular typeahead functionality still works when typing queries
3. **Followers Display**: When followers data is loaded, arrow down should show the followers list

## Expected Behavior

- If no followers are loaded: No dropdown appears when pressing arrow down
- If followers are loaded: Dropdown appears with follower suggestions
- When typing a query: Normal typeahead suggestions work as expected
