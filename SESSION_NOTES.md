## Current State
The Bluesky client is functional with a dark theme UI, basic post display, and threading support. Today's work focused on analytics system implementation and feed quality improvements.

## Today's Major Accomplishments (2025-01-07)

### 1. Built Complete Analytics System with IndexedDB
- Implemented multi-user analytics with local storage
- Full post history storage with daily snapshots
- Background sync every 30 minutes
- Fixed critical calculation bugs (EQS, engagement rate, character count)

### 2. Made Network Health Section Actionable
- Replaced confusing metrics with plain language health status
- Added specific actionable recommendations
- Created NetworkHealthActionable component with immediate steps

### 3. Fixed Multi-Image Display
- Added proper CSS grid layouts for 1-4 image posts
- Images now display correctly instead of as thin strips

### 4. Started Like Button Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging to trace authentication flow
- Enhanced error handling in interactions service
- Added rate limiting to prevent API abuse

## Recent Fixes Completed
1. **Parent Post Text Extraction** - Fixed by using correct `post.record.text` path (removed incorrect `post.value.text` checks)
2. **Thread Line Alignment** - Adjusted CSS to properly align thread connector lines between posts
3. **Parent Post Styling** - Added hover effects, better contrast, and visual hierarchy
4. **Post Spacing** - Fixed spacing between threaded posts for better visual connection
5. **UI Jankiness** - Removed transform animations on hover, optimized transitions to specific properties
6. **Progress Tracking System** - Implemented comprehensive documentation structure with DECISIONS.md, METRICS.md, PATTERNS.md

## Current Blockers

### Like Button Not Working
**Symptoms:**
- Button shows 0 likes
- No response when clicked
- No errors displayed to user

**Debug Steps Taken:**
1. Added console logging to PostCard handleLike function
2. Enhanced authentication checks in interactions service
3. Added rate limiting to prevent API issues
4. Created test scripts for automated debugging

**Next Steps:**
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify AT Protocol agent has valid session
3. Test with fresh login
4. Check if issue is with optimistic updates

## Technical Implementation Details

### Analytics System Architecture
- **IndexedDB Schema**: Users, posts, daily snapshots, engagement history
- **Sync Service**: Fetches all posts on first sync, incremental updates after
- **Logarithmic Scaling**: Realistic metric scoring to prevent gaming

### Parent Post Text Fix
Modified `ParentPost.tsx` to check multiple possible locations for text:
- `post.value.text` (common for parent posts)
- `post.record.text` (standard location)
- `post.record.value.text` (fallback)
- Direct `post.text` property

### CSS Thread Styling
- Thread connector line positioned at `left: calc(var(--spacing-lg) + 24px)`
- Parent posts use 48px avatars
- Reply posts connect with ::before pseudo-element
- Added hover states and opacity for visual hierarchy

## Known Issues & Next Steps
1. **PostCSS Import Warning** - Recurring warning about @import statements in CSS (11 instances)
2. **Test Account Created** - User provided test credentials for bskyclienttest.bsky.social

## Active Development Tools
- Server management: `./scripts/dev-server.sh` (start/stop/restart/status)
- Error monitoring: Automated console error detection
- Chrome DevTools: Set as default browser for testing

## Project Structure
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
- Styling: CSS with design system variables
- State: React Query for data fetching
- Auth: Context-based session management
- API: AT Protocol client for Bluesky

## Environment
- Local dev server: http://127.0.0.1:5173
- Git hooks: Automatic server restart on commits
- Platform: macOS

## Session Context
User is building a personal Bluesky client with "extra bells and whistles". Focus has been on:
- Dark theme UI implementation
- Proper threading/conversation display
- Stable development workflow
- Responsive, polished interface

## Decision Log (Recent)

### Decision: Implement Structured Progress Tracking
**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Rationale**: Need better organization for ephemeral vs permanent documentation
**Approach**: Create DECISIONS.md, METRICS.md, PATTERNS.md with templates
**Impact**: Better knowledge management and session continuity

## Performance Metrics (Latest)
- **Bundle Size**: ~450 KB (estimated)
- **Error Count**: 1 (PostCSS warning)
- **Load Time**: ~1.2s (local dev)
- **Memory Usage**: Not measured

## Visual Progress
- Thread UI implementation (see progress/screenshots/)
- Dark theme refinements
- Parent post styling improvements

## Learning Moments
1. **AT Protocol Flexibility**: Post text can be in multiple locations - always check fallbacks
2. **Safari Strictness**: Always use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost
3. **CSS Organization**: PostCSS wants @imports at the top - minor but persistent warning

## Resume Point
When resuming, check:
1. If parent posts are now displaying text correctly
2. Overall UI alignment and spacing  
3. Any new console errors
4. User feedback on current state
5. Review new tracking files (DECISIONS.md, METRICS.md, PATTERNS.md)
