# Bluesky Client Session Notes

## Last Updated: 2025-01-11 (Notifications App Post Display Update)

## Quick Status
- üü¢ Dev Server: Running
- üìç Current Focus: Improved notifications app post content display
- üîê Security Status: SECURE (all credentials migrated)
- üìä Features Complete: 13/25

## Current State
The Bluesky client is functional with a dark theme UI, proper feed structure matching Bluesky's native client, full thread navigation, and comprehensive analytics. Just completed major security audit and cleanup from a distinguished engineer's perspective.

## Today's Major Accomplishments (2025-01-11)

### 7. Enhanced Notifications App Post Display
- **Updated NotificationItem**: Now shows full post content for all notification types
- **Rich Post Preview**: Displays post author avatar, name, and text in styled card
- **Consistent UI**: Matches the aggregated notification display style
- **Better Context**: Users can now see which post is being acted on in all tabs
- **Maintained Fallback**: Still shows notification.record.text when post data unavailable

### 6. Implemented AGGRESSIVE Rate Limiting (20 req/s max)
- **Global Rate Limit**: Enforces absolute maximum of 20 requests per second
- **Two-Layer System**: Global limiter wraps endpoint-specific limiters
- **Per-Second Limits** (was per-minute):
  - Profile fetching: 5 req/s
  - Feed fetching: 8 req/s  
  - General API calls: 7 req/s
  - Total cannot exceed 20 req/s globally
- **Fixed Token Bucket Algorithm**: More accurate token refill calculation
- **Wrapped ALL API Calls**: Found and wrapped direct calls in:
  - analytics-enhanced.ts
  - analytics-sync.ts
  - Settings.tsx
  - notifications.ts
  - profile.ts
- **Updated UI**: RateLimitStatus component shows queue sizes in real-time
- **Pre-emptive Queuing**: Requests queue automatically when limits reached

### 5. Implemented Comprehensive Rate Limiting System (Earlier)
- Created token bucket rate limiter with queuing support
- Added profile service with automatic rate limiting and caching
- Rate-limited feed service for timeline and author feed requests
- Updated TopAccountsView to use rate-limited profile service
- Added priority support for UI-critical requests
- Implemented automatic cache management with 5-minute TTL
- Created monitoring component for rate limiter statistics

### 1. Completed Security Audit & Credential Migration
- Removed ALL hardcoded credentials from 33+ test files
- Created getTestCredentials() helper for secure credential access
- Added pre-commit hook to prevent future credential leaks
- All test credentials now managed through environment variables
- Security Status: üîê SECURE

### 2. Feed Structure Improvements (Earlier)
- Restructured feed to match Bluesky's native client exactly

- Created custom metrics for user interactions (login, like/unlike, repost)
- Built useRenderTracking hook for component performance monitoring
- Integrated performance tracking into Feed and Login components
- Created performance report script for analysis

### 2. Component Architecture Refactoring
- Split large components into smaller, focused modules

- Enhanced development workflow with performance insights

## Previous Accomplishments (2025-01-07)

### 1. Built Complete Analytics System with IndexedDB
- Implemented multi-user analytics with local storage
- Full post history storage with daily snapshots
- Background sync every 30 minutes
- Fixed critical calculation bugs (EQS, engagement rate, character count)

### 2. Made Network Health Section Actionable
- Replaced confusing metrics with plain language health status
- Added specific actionable recommendations
- Created NetworkHealthActionable component with immediate steps

### 3. Fixed Multi-Image Display
- Added proper CSS grid layouts for 1-4 image posts
- Images now display correctly instead of as thin strips

### 4. Started Like Button Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging to trace authentication flow
- Enhanced error handling in interactions service
- Added rate limiting to prevent API abuse

## Recent Fixes Completed
1. **Parent Post Text Extraction** - Fixed by using correct `post.record.text` path (removed incorrect `post.value.text` checks)
2. **Thread Line Alignment** - Adjusted CSS to properly align thread connector lines between posts
3. **Parent Post Styling** - Added hover effects, better contrast, and visual hierarchy
4. **Post Spacing** - Fixed spacing between threaded posts for better visual connection
5. **UI Jankiness** - Removed transform animations on hover, optimized transitions to specific properties
6. **Progress Tracking System** - Implemented comprehensive documentation structure with DECISIONS.md, METRICS.md, PATTERNS.md

## Current Blockers

None currently - all major features are working as expected.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Tracking Architecture
- **Web Vitals**: Automatic tracking of LCP, FID, CLS, FCP, TTFB, INP
- **Custom Metrics**: Async operation measurements with context
- **Console Reporting**: Color-coded performance insights in development
- **Performance Marks**: Navigation timing and resource loading analysis

### Analytics System Architecture
- **IndexedDB Schema**: Users, posts, daily snapshots, engagement history
- **Sync Service**: Fetches all posts on first sync, incremental updates after
- **Logarithmic Scaling**: Realistic metric scoring to prevent gaming

### Parent Post Text Fix
Modified `ParentPost.tsx` to check multiple possible locations for text:
- `post.value.text` (common for parent posts)
- `post.record.text` (standard location)
- `post.record.value.text` (fallback)
- Direct `post.text` property

### CSS Thread Styling
- Thread connector line positioned at `left: calc(var(--spacing-lg) + 24px)`
- Parent posts use 48px avatars
- Reply posts connect with ::before pseudo-element
- Added hover states and opacity for visual hierarchy

## Known Issues & Next Steps
1. **PostCSS Import Warning** - Recurring warning about @import statements in CSS (11 instances)
2. **Lint Errors** - 175 ESLint errors (mostly unused variables from refactoring)
3. **Test Account Created** - User provided test credentials for bskyclienttest.bsky.social

## Performance Metrics (Latest)
- **Initial Load**: 132ms total (0ms DNS, 0ms TCP, 2ms request, 1ms response)
- **DOM Processing**: 126ms
- **Memory Usage**: 18MB used, 19MB total heap
- **Resources**: 113 total (111 scripts, 1 CSS, 1 other)
- **Slowest Resource**: Google Fonts CSS (68ms)

## Active Development Tools
- Server management: `./scripts/dev-server.sh` (start/stop/restart/status)
- Error monitoring: Automated console error detection
- Chrome DevTools: Set as default browser for testing

## Project Structure
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
- Styling: CSS with design system variables
- State: React Query for data fetching
- Auth: Context-based session management
- API: AT Protocol client for Bluesky

## Environment
- Local dev server: http://127.0.0.1:5173
- Git hooks: Automatic server restart on commits
- Platform: macOS

## Session Context
User is building a personal Bluesky client with "extra bells and whistles". Focus has been on:
- Dark theme UI implementation
- Proper threading/conversation display
- Stable development workflow
- Responsive, polished interface

## Decision Log (Recent)

### Decision: Implement Structured Progress Tracking
**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Rationale**: Need better organization for ephemeral vs permanent documentation
**Approach**: Create DECISIONS.md, METRICS.md, PATTERNS.md with templates
**Impact**: Better knowledge management and session continuity

## Performance Metrics (Latest)
- **Bundle Size**: ~450 KB (estimated)
- **Error Count**: 1 (PostCSS warning)
- **Load Time**: ~1.2s (local dev)
- **Memory Usage**: Not measured

## Visual Progress
- Thread UI implementation (see progress/screenshots/)
- Dark theme refinements
- Parent post styling improvements

## Learning Moments
1. **AT Protocol Flexibility**: Post text can be in multiple locations - always check fallbacks
2. **Safari Strictness**: Always use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost
3. **CSS Organization**: PostCSS wants @imports at the top - minor but persistent warning

## Resume Point
When resuming, check:
1. If parent posts are now displaying text correctly
2. Overall UI alignment and spacing  
3. Any new console errors
4. User feedback on current state
5. Review new tracking files (DECISIONS.md, METRICS.md, PATTERNS.md)
