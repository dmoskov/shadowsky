# Bluesky Client Session Notes

## Last Updated: 2025-01-06 14:15 PST

## Quick Status
- üü¢ Dev Server: Running
- üìç Current Focus: Progress tracking system implementation
- üêõ Active Bugs: 2 (parent post text, UI jankiness)
- üìä Features Complete: 8/25

## Current State
The Bluesky client is functional with a dark theme UI, basic post display, and threading support. Recent work focused on fixing UI issues with parent posts in threads.

## Recent Fixes Completed
1. **Parent Post Text Extraction** - Fixed issue where parent posts showed no text content by adding multiple fallback paths for text extraction
2. **Thread Line Alignment** - Adjusted CSS to properly align thread connector lines between posts
3. **Parent Post Styling** - Added hover effects, better contrast, and visual hierarchy
4. **Post Spacing** - Fixed spacing between threaded posts for better visual connection

## Technical Implementation Details

### Parent Post Text Fix
Modified `ParentPost.tsx` to check multiple possible locations for text:
- `post.value.text` (common for parent posts)
- `post.record.text` (standard location)
- `post.record.value.text` (fallback)
- Direct `post.text` property

### CSS Thread Styling
- Thread connector line positioned at `left: calc(var(--spacing-lg) + 24px)`
- Parent posts use 48px avatars
- Reply posts connect with ::before pseudo-element
- Added hover states and opacity for visual hierarchy

## Known Issues & Next Steps
1. **Parent Post Text Still Missing** - Despite fixes, parent posts may still show "[No text content]" - need to verify actual data structure from API
2. **PostCSS Import Warning** - Recurring warning about @import statements in CSS
3. **UI Polish Needed** - User mentioned "UI is a little janky" - further refinement needed

## Active Development Tools
- Server management: `./scripts/dev-server.sh` (start/stop/restart/status)
- Error monitoring: Automated console error detection
- Chrome DevTools: Set as default browser for testing

## Project Structure
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
- Styling: CSS with design system variables
- State: React Query for data fetching
- Auth: Context-based session management
- API: AT Protocol client for Bluesky

## Environment
- Local dev server: http://127.0.0.1:5173
- Git hooks: Automatic server restart on commits
- Platform: macOS

## Session Context
User is building a personal Bluesky client with "extra bells and whistles". Focus has been on:
- Dark theme UI implementation
- Proper threading/conversation display
- Stable development workflow
- Responsive, polished interface

## Decision Log (Recent)

### Decision: Implement Structured Progress Tracking
**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Rationale**: Need better organization for ephemeral vs permanent documentation
**Approach**: Create DECISIONS.md, METRICS.md, PATTERNS.md with templates
**Impact**: Better knowledge management and session continuity

## Performance Metrics (Latest)
- **Bundle Size**: ~450 KB (estimated)
- **Error Count**: 1 (PostCSS warning)
- **Load Time**: ~1.2s (local dev)
- **Memory Usage**: Not measured

## Visual Progress
- Thread UI implementation (see progress/screenshots/)
- Dark theme refinements
- Parent post styling improvements

## Learning Moments
1. **AT Protocol Flexibility**: Post text can be in multiple locations - always check fallbacks
2. **Safari Strictness**: Always use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost
3. **CSS Organization**: PostCSS wants @imports at the top - minor but persistent warning

## Resume Point
When resuming, check:
1. If parent posts are now displaying text correctly
2. Overall UI alignment and spacing  
3. Any new console errors
4. User feedback on current state
5. Review new tracking files (DECISIONS.md, METRICS.md, PATTERNS.md)
