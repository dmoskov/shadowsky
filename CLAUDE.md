# Project: BSKY

## Overview

This is the CLAUDE.md file for your project. Add project-specific instructions here.

## UI Design Preferences

- **No headers in feed views**: Don't add title/description headers at the top of feed components. The user prefers a clean, header-free interface.
- Feed views should start directly with the content or feed selection controls.
