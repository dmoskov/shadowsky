### Infrastructure Security
- Network segmentation
- Firewall configuration
- Access control lists
- Intrusion detection
- Security monitoring

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Key management
- Data classification
- Privacy protection
- Secure backups

## Workflow

1. **Assess Threats**: Identify potential security risks
2. **Design Controls**: Plan security measures
3. **Implement Security**: Build secure solutions
4. **Test Security**: Verify controls work correctly
